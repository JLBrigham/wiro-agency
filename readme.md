# Wiro Agency - HTML & CSS Challenge

The task was to recreate a webpage that looked as close as possible to [this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74301627/134665862-f82321f7-78ca-4265-9848-b3015050330c.jpg) design file I was given.

## How to run

- Ensure you have node.js, yarn and express.js installed on your machine.
- Clone this repository and navigate to the root of the project
- Run `yarn start`
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the page

## My approach

This was my first attempt at a challenge like this and I enjoyed it alot. I found my progress got alot quicker as I worked, in particular as I became more confident using flexbox which made positioning much easier. Unfortuntaly, as I'm currently on holiday in the UK visiting friends and family, I had prior family commitments which meant I could only spend around 6 hours on the challenge and it is nowhere near finished.

I initially tried to get to grips with Photopea as I had no prior experience with that or Photoshop. In the time I had I couldn't figure out how to export the images so decided the best appraoch was to focus on building the page without any of the images as they could be added later. I filtered them out and worked off the file looking like [this](https://github.com/JLBrigham/wiro-agency/issues/1#issue-100635288) as this seemed like a more managable way to approach the challenge.

To ensure that fonts, icons and images were always available I decided to host them on my own server. To do this I set up a server using express.js

## Improvements and what I would do next

My next steps would be to finish the nav bar, products banners and then move onto the footer. After that I would then look at including the icons and images.

Positioning was what took up the majority of my time. I feel like I have a much better understanding of Flexbox now but would like to learn more about Grid as I think this wouls also have helped me. This is definitely somthing I plan to look into further.

I would have like to have made the page responsive. When building it have followed the dimensions of the file I was sent which seems far wider than you would expect from a standard webpage and does not fit well on my 13inch screen. In order to make the page responsive I would like to look into using media queries, they aren't something I am familiar with at the moment so are something I am keen to learn more about.

I didn't use any CSS frameworks, it would however be interesting to look into frameworks I could have used to make my workflow quicker. However as I am still learning and improving on some aspects of CSS it felt like it was benficial for me to write everything from scratch as this will give me a better understanding if I use frameworks in future.
